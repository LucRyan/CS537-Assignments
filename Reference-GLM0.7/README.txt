GLM Version 0.7 Demo

Loads a model from an obj file using GLM library and then loads all the vertices and normals into a VBO.
Renders object using the VBO.

Note: The extension only loads vertices and normals. Does not recognize groups and does not load UV or materials.
You have to get this data yourself from the model struct.
